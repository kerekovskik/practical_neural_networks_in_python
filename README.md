# practical_neural_networks_in_python
This course introduces the practical applications of neural networks and deep learning using Python. By the end of this course, students will be able to understand, implement, train, and evaluate various types of neural networks using Python libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

# Cost Functions (30 minutes)
- Define what a cost function is and its role in neural networks. Use the analogy of a GPS navigation system: the cost function helps the model navigate towards the correct solution in the vast 'terrain' of parameter space by providing feedback on how 'far off' the model's current predictions are from the actual outcomes.
- Discuss various types of cost functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross-Entropy, and Log Loss. Use equations to illustrate each function.
- Discuss how the choice of cost function can depend on the problem at hand (e.g., regression, binary classification, multi-class classification).
- Include real-world examples of scenarios where different cost functions would be appropriate.
